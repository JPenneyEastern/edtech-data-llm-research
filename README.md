# Edtech-Data-LLM-Research-Evaluation
Learning journal as I transition into data science/educational technology/research

#I am an educator, APA research enthusiast and data science graduate student transitioning into data analytics, educational technology, social science research, LLM, and evaluation work. This repo is a place for me to:

-practice data skills form my coursework
-explore how LLMs behave on educational tasks
-document what I'm learning as I go
-reflect on evaluation quality and accuracy

## Current Areas of Practice
- Python fundamentals (pandas, data cleaning, EDA)
- Working with CSVs and real-world datasets
- Early SQL practice
- Planning dashboards and data storytelling
- Data Analytics and Statistical Modeling with R

## Upcoming Areas of Study
-Data manipulation
-Foundations of Machine Learning Models
-Applied Machine Learning
-Ethical and Philosophical Issues

## Notes
This is a beginner-level learning space — I'm building skills and documenting my 
progress publicly as I transition careers. I'll continue adding small examples and 
reflections as I grow.
